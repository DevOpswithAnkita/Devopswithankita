#  What is DevOps?

DevOps is the solution for common development and operations issues/problems.

##  DevOps Helps the Team With:

- Communication
- Collaboration
- Integration

## DevOps Aims To:

-  Shorten the development life cycle
-  Provide continuous delivery
-  Ensure high-quality software

##  What DevOps Does:

DevOps streamlines both development (Dev) and operations (Ops) activities, promoting efficiency, reliability, and faster release cycles.



# Responsibilities Covered by DevOps

A DevOps approach focuses on automating and streamlining the software development and deployment process. Here's what it typically includes:


### 1. **Code Management**
-  Code management, code merging, review, and keeping code in a centralized location.

### 2. **Build Automation**
- Automating software builds and managing build status using CI (Continuous Integration) tools.

### 3. **Automated Testing**
-  Using continuous testing tools that provide quick and timely feedback to reduce business risks.

### 4. **Application Packaging**
- Managing artifact repositories and preparing applications for pre-deployment.

### 5. **Release Management**
- Handling change management, release approvals, and release automation.

### 6. **Configuration Management**
- Handling infrastructure settings using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools for consistent environments.

### 7. **System Monitoring**
- Tracking performance, availability, and user experience through monitoring tools and dashboards.


**DevOps Engineers** With the help of DevOps tools, engineers can handle everything from coding to monitoring.



# Evolution: Waterfall → Agile → DevOps

##  Waterfall Model

- **Oldest method** (1970).
- Follows a **step-by-step** process: one phase completes before the next starts.
- **Problems**: Too rigid, customer feedback comes **only at the end**, and **delivery is slow**.
- **Example**: Big heavy block being dragged through the project.

>  *"This project got so big, I'm not sure I'll be able to deliver it!"*

---

##  Agile Methodology

- Introduced in **2001**.
- Delivers work in **small pieces (sprints)**.
- Involves **early and continuous feedback**.
- More **flexible and faster** than Waterfall.
- **Example**: Small modular sections placed easily.

> *"It’s better to deliver the project in bite-sized sections!"*

## DevOps

- Evolved from Agile in **2009**.
- Combines **Development + Operations**.
- Focuses on:
  - Continuous Integration (CI)
  - Continuous Deployment (CD)
  - Automation
  - Monitoring
- Uses powerful **DevOps tools**:
  - Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, etc.
- Ensures **fast, frequent, and reliable delivery** of software.

##  Simple Analogy for Learners

| Model     | Analogy                      |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| Waterfall | One big meal at the end      |
| Agile     | Small meals over time        |
| DevOps    | Fast delivery with feedback  |

## DevOps Tools in Action

- Write & merge code → **Git**
- Run automatic tests → **Jenkins**
- Build & deploy → **Docker, Kubernetes**
- Monitor performance → **Prometheus, Grafana**
